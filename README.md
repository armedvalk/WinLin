## Introduction

Throughout history, the Church has faced numerous deviations from the apostolic faith. Today, a range of movements challenge the teachings of the Orthodox Church, often claiming new revelations or reinterpretations of Scripture. This book aims to carefully examine some of the most prevalent modern heresies and provide clear, theologically grounded refutations from an Oriental Orthodox perspective.  

Our goal is not to demean individuals but to defend the truth of Christ’s teaching, preserving the faith handed down through the Apostles and the Holy Fathers.

## Understanding Heresy

Heresy is any teaching that distorts, rejects, or replaces the truth revealed by God through Christ and preserved in the Church. Key indicators include:

- Denial of the Holy Trinity  
- Rejection of Christ’s true divinity and humanity  
- Replacement of Scripture with extra-biblical revelation  
- Departure from apostolic teaching and tradition  

Understanding the nature of heresy is crucial before refuting it. Effective refutation requires knowledge of Scripture, Church Fathers, and historical context.

## Islam

### Origins and Beliefs
Islam was founded by Muhammad in the 7th century. Key beliefs include:

- The oneness of God (Tawhid)  
- Prophethood of Muhammad  
- The Qur’an as divine revelation  
- Denial of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ  

### Orthodox Refutation
1. **Denial of Christ’s Divinity**  
   - Islam teaches that Jesus (Isa) was only a prophet, not God incarnate.  
   - Oriental Orthodox theology affirms Christ as fully God and fully man (Miaphysitism).  
   - Scripture: John 1:1–14; Colossians 2:9  

2. **Qur’anic Contradictions with Scripture**  
   - Qur’an contradicts the Torah and Gospel on key theological points (e.g., crucifixion, nature of God).  
   - Historical evidence shows the Qur’an postdates the Apostolic writings by centuries.  

3. **Logical and Moral Inconsistencies**  
   - Ethical directives in the Qur’an sometimes conflict with the moral law revealed in the Bible.

## Mormonism

### Origins and Beliefs
- Founded by Joseph Smith in the 19th century in the United States.  
- Claims additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants).  
- Teaches that God was once a man, humans can become gods, and that Christ is a created being.  

### Orthodox Refutation
1. **Extra-Biblical Scripture**  
   - The Church affirms the canonical Bible as the complete revelation.  
   - New revelations contradict the Apostolic tradition.  

2. **Christology**  
   - Mormonism denies the eternal divinity of Christ.  
   - Scripture: Hebrews 1:3; John 10:30  

3. **Doctrine of Deification Misapplied**  
   - Orthodox theology teaches theosis (union with God), not becoming God by essence.

## Jehovah’s Witnesses

### Origins and Beliefs
- Founded by Charles Taze Russell in the 19th century.  
- Deny the Trinity, the immortality of the soul, and eternal punishment.  
- Reject blood transfusions, celebrating traditional Christian holidays, and mainstream Church authority.  

### Orthodox Refutation
1. **Anti-Trinitarianism**  
   - JW theology reduces Christ to a created being.  
   - Scripture: Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14  

2. **Misinterpretation of Hell and Salvation**  
   - Orthodox teaching affirms eternal separation from God for the unrepentant.  
   - JW rejection of the immortal soul is inconsistent with biblical anthropology.  

3. **Isolation from the Church**  
   - Faith requires communion with the Body of Christ; JW practices encourage separation.

## Seventh-Day Adventists

### Origins and Beliefs
- Emerged in the 19th century from the Millerite movement.  
- Emphasize Sabbath observance on Saturday and health codes.  
- Teach conditional immortality and investigative judgment.  

### Orthodox Refutation

   - The Church celebrates the Lord’s Day (Sunday) in honor of Christ’s resurrection.  
   - Scriptural precedent: Acts 20:7; 1 Corinthians 16:2  

2. **Conditional Immortality**  
   - Orthodox theology affirms the soul’s immortality and the reality of eternal life or separation.  

3. **Investigative Judgment**  
   - Contradicts the biblical teaching of Christ as the final judge at His second coming.

## Black Hebrew Israelites

### Origins and Beliefs
- A modern movement claiming African descent as the true Israelites.  
- Some sects mix Old Testament law with racial ideologies.  

### Orthodox Refutation

   - Salvation is through Christ alone, not ethnic lineage.  
   - Galatians 3:28–29 emphasizes unity in Christ.  

2. **Law vs. Grace**  
   - Overemphasis on Torah observance neglects Christ’s fulfillment of the law.  
   - Romans 10:4; Colossians 2:14  

3. **Historical Inaccuracy**  
   - Claims about lineage are unsupported by historical or genetic evidence.

## Scientology

### Origins and Beliefs
- Founded by L. Ron Hubbard in the 20th century.  
- Teaches spiritual rehabilitation through auditing, belief in past lives, and the immortal spirit (thetan).  

### Orthodox Refutation
1. **Pseudoscientific Theology**  
   - No historical or scriptural basis for Hubbard’s revelations.  

2. **Denial of Christ and Redemption**  
   - Salvation in Orthodox theology comes solely through Christ’s death and resurrection.  
   - 1 Timothy 2:5; John 14:6  

3. **Psychological Manipulation**  
   - Practices exploit fear rather than guide souls to true spiritual life.

## Non-Trinitarian Movements

### Common Characteristics
- Denial of the Trinity  
- Subordinationism (Christ as lesser than God)  
- Replacement or reinterpretation of Scripture  

### Orthodox Refutation
1. **Scriptural Witness**  
   - Trinity affirmed throughout Scripture: Matthew 28:19; John 1:1–14; 2 Corinthians 13:14  

2. **Historical Continuity**  
   - Apostolic Fathers and Ecumenical Councils preserved the truth against early heresies (Arianism, Ebionism, etc.).  

3. **Logical Necessity**  
   - Only a fully God-man Savior can redeem humanity.

## Conclusion

The preservation of Orthodox truth requires discernment, charity, and courage. Modern heresies may claim novelty or inclusivity, but they ultimately distort God’s revelation in Christ. By adhering to Scripture, the teachings of the Church Fathers, and the unbroken tradition of the Apostolic faith, believers can confidently defend the faith and guide others toward salvation in Christ.
